# News Sources App

News Sources is a comprehensive web application that aims to simplify the process of finding news online.

With the multitude of news sources available, it can be exhausting and time-consuming to browse through different websites to get the latest updates on various topics.

This app addresses that challenge by aggregating news sources from different categories, providing users with a one-stop platform to access a wide range of news content.

The app allows a user to:
- View news article headlines.
- See the author/source of a news article.
- View different news categories and get articles for a selected category.
- Search for different news articles.
- Read full news article by clicking on the linked article.
- Get our contacts for more enquiry.
